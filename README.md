## What's Happening?

1. **Training Data** (ðŸŽ²): Numbers we want our AI to learn from
   - Input: `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`
   - Each number gets stacked into a tower shape

2. **Neural Network** (ðŸ§ ): A simple linear model that learns the pattern
   - Tries to learn the recipe: `output = input Ã— 2 + 1`
   - Has weights and biases that it adjusts during training

3. **Learning Process** (ðŸ“š):
   - Makes predictions
   - Compares with correct answers
   - Updates its understanding
   - Repeats 500 times to get better!

## Running the Project

```bash
cargo run
```

Watch as the AI learns! The "loss" number gets smaller as it gets better at predictions.

## Dependencies
- Rust
- tch (PyTorch for Rust)
